Puppet-driven local group modification capabilities for Linux systems
gpasswd

This is a module that enhances the native group type on systems
supporting gpasswd to allow for the manipulation of group memebers.

Specifically, it adds the `:manages_members` attribute to the native
Puppet group type. No alterations to your group code are required!

Examples
========

```puppet
group { 'test':
  members => ['foo','bar','baz']
}
```
